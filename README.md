# Godot_Projects
This is a repository of any games I make trying to learn Godot.

**Dodge the Creeps 01**

I followed the "Your First Game" tutorial on the Godot website to make this game: (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html).

This folder only contains my source code for the game because the exported projects that I made to play the game without the Godot engine were to big for Github to take. I instead uploaded an executable Windows file to my itch.io page: https://third-from-the-left.itch.io/dodge-the-creeps
